### Analytics

Supported: Google Analytics, GoatCounter, and Plausible.

Example config:

```yaml
analytics:
  google:
    id: "G-XXXXXXX"
  goatcounter:
    id: "example"
    selfhosted: false
  plausible:
    domain: "example.com" # tracked site
    script_url: "" # optional; set to your self-hosted instance URL (e.g. https://plausible.example.com/js/script.js)
```

GoatCounter:
If `selfhosted: true`, `id` must be the full host (FQDN) of your instance. Otherwise `id` is used as the subdomain on `goatcounter.com`.

Plausible:
Set `domain` to the site you want to track. For self-hosted, set `script_url` to your instance’s script URL.
